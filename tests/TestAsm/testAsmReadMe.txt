About:
An automation tool for debugging purposes.
Written in Python with Pycharm and packed to executable.

How to operate:
Place in a folder with a "memin.txt" file, then run "testAsm.exe" and get a translated memin file.

The Python script takes as input a memin file which is the output of the assembler, and translates it back to assembly from binary with the proper line address.
